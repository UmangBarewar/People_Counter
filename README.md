# People Counter using YOLOv8

This repository contains Python code for a people counter using YOLOv8. The system counts the number of people passing through designated areas in a video feed.

## Overview

The people counter system is built using YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art object detection model. It utilizes the COCO dataset for training and inference. The system detects people in a video stream and tracks their movement to count the total number of people passing through defined regions.
